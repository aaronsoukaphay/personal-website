      <h1 className="text-xl">
        I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine, with a
        degree in Biological Sciences. While my academic journey began in the
        life sciences, my true passion lies in the dynamic world of web
        development. Holding a degree in science has instilled in me a strong
        foundation in research, critical thinking, and problem-solving. This
        background, combined with my passion for web development, brings a
        unique perspective to my work.
